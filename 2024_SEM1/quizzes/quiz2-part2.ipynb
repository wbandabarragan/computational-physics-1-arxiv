    "The Earth's atmosphere cools down with altitude. To model this we can assume that the air is adiabatic with an equation of state given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p^{1-\\gamma}\\,T^{\\gamma} = \\rm constant$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the thermal pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\gamma=1.4$ is the polytropic index. The above equation results in the following differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dp}{p}=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\frac{dT}{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dp}{p}=-\\frac{\\mu_m\\,g}{R\\,T}\\,dz$, \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_m=28.97\\,\\rm g\\,mol^{-1}$ is the molecular weight of the gas, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $z$ is height above ground level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the two equations above, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dT}{dz}=-\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\mu_m\\,g}{R}$,\n",
    "\n",

    "$T=T_0\\left(1-\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)$, \n",

    "(a) Create a Python function that receives $T_0=25\\,\\rm ^{\\circ}C$ and $z$ as inputs, and returns:\n",

    "- the value of $z_0$ in $\\rm km$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- the function $T(z)$ with $T$ in $\\rm ^{\\circ}C$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Code a Python function that returns a pcolor map of $T(z)$ (i.e. of the stratified atmosphere) interpolated on an ($x \\times y$) = ($20\\,\\rm km\\times 20\\,\\rm km$) grid with $z$ on the vertical axis. Consider that the temperature does not vary across $x$, only with height, $z$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Create a Python function that adds a (small-amplitude) stochastic force field to the one calculated above, and returns a quiver map showing the direction of the resulting buoyancy plus stochastic forces in the atmosphere. What does this stochastic force field represent?"

    "This problem consists of analysing the underlying periodity of the observed sunspots on the Sun (see some images here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot). The data file provided below contains the observed number of sunspots on the Sun for each month since January 1749 (month 0). The file contains two columns of numbers, the first representing the month and the second being the sunspot number.\n",
