    "We want to study the properties of turbulent flows using numerical calculus and Fourier analysis. Let us consider the Orszag-Tang vortex system, which describes a doubly periodic fluid configuration leading to 2D supersonic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence. Although an analytical solution is not known, its simple and reproducible set of initial conditions has made it a widespread benchmark for the comparison of MHD numerical solvers.\n",
