    "### 1. (7 points) Orbital dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists of computing and displaying the orbits of Mars' moons (Phobos and Deimos) around Mars and the Sun:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phobos has an orbital period of $T_{phobos} = 7.65\\,\\rm hours$ around Mars and is located at a distance of $5.99\\times 10^3\\,\\rm km$ from Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deimos has an orbital period $T_{deimos} = 30.30\\,\\rm hours$ around Mars and is located at a distance of $2.35\\times 10^4\\,\\rm km$ from Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we can assume that all the orbits are circular. Thus, the Mars' orbit around the Sun is described by the following parametric equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{mars} = R\\,\\cos(\\omega_{mars}\\,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{mars} = R\\,\\sin(\\omega_{mars}\\,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R=2.1\\times 10^8\\,\\rm km$ is the Sun-Mars distance, $\\omega_{mars}=\\frac{2\\pi}{T_{mars}}$, and $T_{mars} = 687\\,\\rm days$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the orbits of each moon ($i$) is the sum of its position relative to Mars and the position of Mars relative to the Sun (which is at the origin), so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{i} = x_{mars} + r_i\\,\\cos(\\omega_{i}\\,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{i} = y_{mars} + r_i\\,\\sin(\\omega_{i}\\,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ refers to either Phobos and Deimos, $r_i$ to their distances from Mars, and $\\omega_{i}=\\frac{2\\pi}{T_{i}}$ refers to their respective angular frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a python function that takes the period ($T$) as argument and returns the angular frequency ($\\omega$) of any body.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Then, call your function in (a) and assign to three global python variables the angular frequencies of: i) Mars while orbiting around the Sun, (ii) Phobos, and (iii) Deimos orbiting around Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a vector for time, $t$, that spans from $0$ to $687 \\,\\rm days$, and define $R$ and $r_i$ as global variables.\n",

    "(d) Create a python function that takes $R$, $r_i$, $t$ as arguments and returns $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ for either Phobos or Deimos.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Then, call your function in (d), retrieve $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$, and save them into a CSV file with 7 columns: $t$, $x_{mars}$, $y_{mars}$, $x_{phobos}$, $y_{phobos}$, $x_{deimos}$, $y_{deimos}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Make a 2D Cartesian plot, with the Sun in the origin, showing the orbits of Mars, Phobos, and Deimos around the Sun for a full Martian year. Which orbit is more intricate?\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Make a 2D Cartesian plot, with Mars in the origin, showing the orbits of Phobos and Deimos around it for a full Deimos period."

    "This data file contains emission line features from neutral hydrogen ($\\rm H\\,I$, i.e., $\\lambda = 21\\,\\rm cm$) in the Milky Way. The second column has gas velocities (in $\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) and the third column emission intensity (called brightness temperature in $K$). We can assume that each gas cloud in our line of sight produces a Gaussian emission feature that is only dependent on the column density if the gas is optically thin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carry out the following calculations using python: \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a python function that reads in the spectral data (velocity and intensity) from the file, and returns them as arrays. **Hint:** You need to jump over the header of the data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Make a high-quality, labeled plot of the spectrum (velocity on the x-axis and intensity on the y-axis). How many \"$\\rm H\\,I$ clouds\" do you see? Note that each Gaussian-like feature represents a separate $\\rm H\\,I$ cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Define an appropriate multi-Gaussian model for the spectrum and create a python function for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Fit your model to the spectrum, and report the best-fit values for the free parameters with their respective uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Make a high-quality, labeled plot that shows the original spectrum, the overall multi-Gaussian fit, and also each individual Gaussian component.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Find the (velocity, intensity) coordinates of the maximum of each Gaussian component. **Note:** the velocity coordinates of the maxima are called central velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Use the coordinates of the maxima computed in (f) to compare the central velocities of the clouds, and calculate the relative velocity between the clouds. "
