    "\n",
    "Log-normal distributions are important in physics, e.g. they characterise the density fields, $\\rho$, of supersonically-turbulent flows. A log-normal distribution can generally be defined by two variables, $\\bar\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, which represent the mean and standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution.\n",

    "(d) Make a plot of the probability density function of $\\rho$ for $\\bar\\mu=10$ and $\\sigma=50$.\n",

    "(g) Make a new plot overplotting the analytical function produced in (d) and the histogram produced in (f).\n",
