    "## 1. (9 points): Describing weather balloon flight\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather balloons are used to study the atmospheric conditions in specific geographical locations. They carry several instruments on board, which collect data on atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed, etc, which are send back to the ground using radio frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists on reading a data file collected by one of such balloons (the Eagle weather balloon, see: https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/weather-balloon-data) with the aim of understanding the correlations between atmospheric parameters and the balloon flight dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download data file:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-1/blob/main/exams/data_sets/weather-balloon-data.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data I/O / manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a python function that uses pandas to open the CSV data file containing the information on the Eagle weather balloon flight and returns the following arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- time\n",
    "- altitude\n",
    "- pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Inspect the data arrays. You will notice that the time stamps are given as: \"HH:MM:SS\", so you should convert them into seconds. Create a python function that takes the \"HH:MM:SS\" strings and returns the time in seconds (**Hint:** you can use the **time_str.split()** function for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Use your function from (b) to convert the time vector to seconds. **Hint:** the original time stamps are strings, so you would probably need a for loop for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1D pressure model via regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Now, you are going to create a 1D pressure model. Make a plot of pressure in the Y axis versus altitude in the X axis. Write down a physically motivated model with free parameters to describe the data. **Hint:** you have done something similar in CW2.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Carry out a regression to fit the data and find the free parameters in your model. Report the resulting function, and make a labeled plot showing the data and the fit. **Hint:** you may need to provide ansatsz for the free parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balloon dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) In this section, you will study the dynamics of the balloon. Make a plot of altitude in the Y axis versus time in the X axis. Briefly describe what you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Determine and print the time stamp at which the baloon reached its highest altitude. How long did it take it to arrive there?\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Calculate the vertical velocity and acceleration of the balloon.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Make a 3-panel figure showing 3 plots: one for the height, one the vertical velocity and one for the acceleration, all versus time. What kind of motion does the balloon follow?"

    "This problem consists of analysing the underlying periodity of the observed sunspots on the Sun (see some images here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot). The data file provided below contains the observed number of sunspots on the Sun for each month since January 1749 (month 0). The file contains two columns of numbers, the first representing the month and the second being the sunspot number.\n",

    "(h) Call your function and make a plot of the 1D Fourier power spectrum of the sunspot signal. Are there peaks at nonzero frequency values? What do they represent? \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Find the frequency of the highest nonzero peak. Using this frequency, calculate and print the Solar cycle period and compare it to the one obtained in (f).\n",

    "\n",
    "(j) Write a function that filters outs all frequencies lower and higher than the frequency of the peak and returns the inverse Fourier transformed signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "The file provided below **First_View_of_Earth_from_Moon3.jpeg** contains an image of the Moon, taken by one of the Lunar Orbiter satellites (1966 - 1967). The Lunar Orbiters (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunarorb.html) were mapping the Moon by taking pictures with film cameras. The film was scanned by a machine on the satellite and sent back to Earth through radio signals. Because of the scanning method there are clear artefacts in the images. Your task is to remove them.\n",
